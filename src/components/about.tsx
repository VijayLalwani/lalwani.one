      I spend my time hosting services, breaking (and fixing) tech,
      and experimenting with open-source projects. When I&apos;m not in front of
      a terminal, I&apos;m probably listening to music, building overly
      complicated LEGO sets, or trying to convince myself that trading isn&apos;t
      just glorified gambling. WSB to the moon ðŸš€ðŸš€
